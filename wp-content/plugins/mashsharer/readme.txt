<p><small><em>This Benchmarks were executed on Intel i5 2.3Ghz, 8GB DDR3, using an APC opcode/object cache without any DB or file Cache Plugin like W3Total, WordPress v4.0, and P3 v1.5.2 ( Attempt to disable opcode optimizers - 
Otherwise some plugins can not be tested) and in manual mode to make sure that
for every plugin the same page is loaded. Automatic excecution of P3 would randomly load WordPress pages which is inaccurate for testing on same conditions. All plugins were benchmarked on sepearate instances with no other 
plugins enabled.
The benchmarks were runned a few times to make sure that any internal plugin caching function is fired. E.g. MashShare gets only really fast after second load of a page because the sharecount must be returned from external 
service first and than stored into internal object cache.
This benchmarks give only a vast overview of performance differences and results will vary on other WordPress installations depending on different hardware and software configurations.
</em></small></p>
<strong>Please note:</strong>
For this test the P3 Option 'Attempt to disable opcode optimizers' is enabled (Otherwise some plugin benchmarks returns no benchmark times ). 
So real execution time of every single Plugin is faster (probaby with a similar factor for all benchmarked plugins) but can not be measured exactely with my testing environment.

After installation goto the settings page Settings->MashShare and make your changes there.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

> Find here the Frequently Asked Questions. If your question is not answered look at:
https://www.mashshare.net/faq/

<h4>There are no social share buttons visible after updating or installing MashShare</h4>
This happens sometimes when you are using the MashShare Network Add-On which is disabled during update process or when your are updating from a very early MashShare version 1.x.
Solution: Disable MashShare Social Media Network Add-On and MashShare Core plugin. Enable first MashShare THAN the Social Media Network Add-On and all Social Media Share buttons become visible again. (Activating order is important here)

<h4>Why is the Social Media total count not shown immediately after sharing?</h4>
It takes some time for the script to detect the sharing. So wait a few minutes than you see the total calculated clicks. Keep also in mind the caching time you defined in the admin panel.
So when you set the plugin to 5minutes caching time. You have to wait at least for 5minutes until the click count is shown.

<h4>Do i need a MashShare or sharedcount account?</h4>
No you donÂ´t. Only when you like to see the total share count you need a free sharedyount.com account for up to 10.000 daily requests. For most websites this is suitable enough as MashShare make use of exensive caching so 
the requests to sharedount are reduced to a little. If you want to have more often updated share counts you can register at sharecount for a free account and than are able
to use a free api key which increases your daily request limit up to 50.000 which should be fine for very large websites. Within the settings page of MashShare Share buttons you find the sharedcount register link.

<h4>Does this plugin sends any personal user data to you or to Facebook, Twitter etc.?</h4>

No, there is no personal data send to Facebook, Twitter, Google and other services. There is also no data which goes to MashShare that includes any IP or other data without your explicit grant.
The big advantage of using this Mashare Share buttons is the independance in comparision to other plugins which creates steady connections to Facebook and Co. 
So there is no IP based data send to the social networks or to sharedcount. 

<h4>Do i have to do manual changes in Javascript or HTML Code?</h4>
There is no need for you to make any manual changes. The plugin does everything for you. But if you are an experienced web-developer you are free to use the php function mashsharer(); in your templates.

<h4>Is there a shortcode for pages and posts?</h4>
Use the shortcode [mashshare] to embed the Share Buttons in pages or posts.

<h4>Why do i get a blank page when i try to activate or uninstall the plugin</h4>
Most times this is a result of some php server limits. Check your logfiles to see which values must be increased.
I can also assist you with such problems, but keep in mind that they are mostly not caused by this plugin.

<h4>When i click on the Social Media share buttons, nothing happens and no popup window</h4>
Mostly that is because you are using any third party and outdated theme which is not coded very well by the author and is not using the Wordpress API for embeding external plugin script.
For MashSharer make sure your website source contains the script /mashsharer/assets/mashsharer.js

So if you have no chance to update or change your theme do some hardcoding and put the following line into the head template of your theme file:
`<script type='text/javascript' src='http://yourwebsite.com/wp-content/plugins/mashsharer/assets/mashsharer.js?ver=1.1'></script>`

<h4>Why is Facebook only sharing the URL and not the title and description of my page?</h4>
Facebook does not supports custom titles, descriptions and images in its share helper sharer.php but you can use open graph meta tags to show the desired custom formats. 
So if you theme does not suppport open graph meta tags (you see them in the html header as og: tags) use the MashShare Add-On:
[Open Graph Social Optimization] (https://www.mashshare.net/downloads/mashshare-open-graph/)

After installation, check with the [Facebook Open graph debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) how Facebook is seeing your site and click on "fetch new data" to purge the Facebook Open Graph cache when your open graph changes are not accepted immediately.
